# Page Colourizer

This is a Chrome extension that grabs a random palette from [ColourLovers.com](http://www.colourlovers.com/) and applies it to the current tab. Click the heart button in your browser and you'll see a palette of up to five colors, which will be applied at random to the page you're viewing.

Click the Shuffle Colors button to reapply the current palette in a different way to the current tab. If you have a ColourLovers.com account and are signed in, you can Love and Favorite palettes right from the extension.

## Planned Features

- Allow saving a palette for a site so each time you load that site later, the same palette gets applied.

- Allow you to pick a color and the extension grabs a palette that uses that color.

## Credits

This is built using the [ColourLovers API](http://www.colourlovers.com/api) and [jQuery](http://jquery.com/).

## Disclaimer

I am not associated with ColourLovers.com and this is not an officially sanctioned ColourLovers.com extension. I just like their site and wanted to make use of their API.
