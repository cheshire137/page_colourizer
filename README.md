# Page Colourizer

This is a Chrome extension that grabs a random palette from [ColourLovers.com](http://www.colourlovers.com/) and applies it to the current tab. Click the heart button in your browser and you'll see a palette of up to five colors, which will be applied haphazardly to the page you're viewing.

No real purpose to this extension yet, but I have high hopes of doing something cool with it.

Planned features:

- Allow you to change the usage of colors on the page, so you pick which of the palette's colors is used for text, for the background, for links, etc.

- Look for colorized containers in the specific page, such as `div`s that have a background set on them, and apply a palette color to the element instead.

- Provide more info about each palette, such as a link to its page on ColourLovers, author details, color names, etc.
