# Page Colourizer

This is a Chrome extension [available in the Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/page-colourizer/jgegaianabmabodmfpacefnieamfjene) that grabs a random palette from [ColourLovers.com](http://www.colourlovers.com/) and applies it to the current tab. Click the heart button in your browser and you'll see a palette of up to five colors, which will be applied haphazardly to the page you're viewing.

No real purpose to this extension yet, but I have high hopes of doing something cool with it.

Planned features:

- Allow you to change the usage of colors on the page, so you pick which of the palette's colors is used for text, for the background, for links, etc.

- Allow saving a palette for a site so each time you load that site later, the same palette gets applied.

- Add Shuffle Colors button that changes how the current palette is applied to the page.

- Allow you to pick a color and the extension grabs a palette that uses that color.

- Add a Colour Frenzy option that will colorize every page automatically, as soon as it loads.

- Add Favorite, Love links for each palette.
